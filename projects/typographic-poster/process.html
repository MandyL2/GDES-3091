					<h2> Inspirations </h2>

						Since the content of the event was about the Web and society, I wanted to go for a futuristic
						technology look as the topics advance together.

					<h2> Rough Sketches </h2>
					<p>
						This version was meant to be a single page, where the title would be seen first and take up
						the entire screen. The user would then scroll down to see the second half, so it would almost
						be like seeing 2 different pages when they were actually on a singular page. This design was
						heavily influenced by the top right and bottom right inspirations shown above. At the time I
						didn’t see that images weren’t allowed, which is why a lot of the drafts have them. Because
						my typeface was so large and blocky, I decided to use it for the title of the event. The
						blues and purples of the background and boxes were meant to contrast against the
						orange-yellow colour I had in my typeface. I also wanted to try animating the circles in a
						rotating motion.

						Although I liked the first version, I was unsure how achievable it would be. In the second
						version, I simplified it which ended up looking more like it was influenced more by the top
						right and bottom left inspirations, with elements from the previous design as well. Clicking
						the “Morning Program” box was going to either redirect to another page to display the three
						boxes about the studio sessions taking place, or trigger an animation that scrolled down to
						them, similar to the previous singular page idea. The description was meant to fade in from
						left to right and replace the title once the user hovered over it, and this circle was also
						intended to rotate. I decided to go with the second design, but with the functionality of the
						first version. However I wanted to try making the circle from the first version.

						At first, I thought a monospace font would fit the aesthetic, but it felt too bulky for the
						paragraph texts and not futuristic. I think this type of monospace font is associated more
						with older web/tech aesthetics, but I kept this kind of style for the headers as a nod to
						them. Afterwards, I looked for a sans-serif font that felt neater. I decided to use Roboto
						Condensed from google fonts.

						There was a lot of blank space between the first half and the second half of the page, so I
						decided to place the event description there instead of the fade in effect. It lets the
						viewers know the general idea as they’re transitioning into the program details. I was also
						able to make it and the program details fade in as the user scrolled down, making the poster
						more dynamic. I wanted to give the containers chamfered borders, but it didn’t work out
						unfortunately.
