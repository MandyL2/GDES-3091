				<h2> Reading 3: Touring Complete User </h2>
			</a>
			<h3> 1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? </h3>
			I think Lialina is a bit dissatisfied with the current use of the word “user.” She thinks that is a
			pity to narrow down the various roles we can fill as “users” because there are so many things we
			can do with new media. Lialina goes through how the meaning and use of this word evolved in UXD,
			and claims that the use of the word “user” should be done carefully, because replacing it with
			“people” erases the distinction between developers and users. Without the distinction, users may
			not be able to demand better software or get their files back, among other rights. “Users”
			encompasses many different types, such as the Invisible User, Real Users, or the General Purpose
			User, pointed out by Lialina. She disagrees with Lev Manovich’s doubts about the word “user,” and
			Don Norman’s refusal to address Users as Users. Users were always here and didn’t develop after
			computers and developers. They were what programmers and hackers used to describe themselves.
			Lialina talks about a few more cases on the word “user,” and concludes that users should be
			educated more about themselves.
			<h3>
				2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.
			</h3>
			Lialina’s ideal internet user is the General Purpose User. They can also be called Universal User
			or Turing Complete Users, referring to Alan Turing’s Universal Turing Machine, that could
			supposedly “solve any logical task given enough time and memory.” In the same way, these users are
			able to complete tasks in various ways without needing an app that was specifically programmed for
			it. This could be shaving in front of a web cam, tweet without twitter, or layout business cards in
			Excel. Their mindset is to work with both hardware and software, and their interaction with these
			interfaces makes the user visible to themselves, unlike the development of the Invisible User
			mentioned at the beginning of the article. Lialina states that all users have the potential to be a
			Universal User. This type of user isn’t meant to be exotic or super extraordinary. She concludes
			the article with a statement to emphasize this. “There is nothing one user can do, that another
			can’t given enough time and respect. Computer Users are Turing Complete.”
			<h3>
				From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that
				can be filled by users"?
			</h3>
			Uploading images to Instagram on the web browser has gaps that can be filled by users. After
			selecting an image (or more) and adjusting the cropping, the users are then given the option to
			edit the photos. Users can apply a filter or adjust things such as the brightness, contrast, and
			saturation of an image before uploading to their page. Instead of immediately uploading to the
			grid, Instagram has stops for user input. Most social media or photo uploading sites have this
			format as well but may have additional features as well. For example, Twitter doesn’t have a gap
			for image adjustments other than cropping, but it does have an option to schedule tweets, adding
			another gap to the process that allows users to queue up content. Beyond image adjustments, there
			are a lot more gaps in websites/web apps that are meant to be filled by users. The basic flow
			starts with selecting images that will then be posted to the web as the end goal but is broken up
			into multiple parts with opportunities for user interaction before completing this flow.
