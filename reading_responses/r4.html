						<h3>
							Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree
							with her? Please explain your answer.
						</h3>
						<p>
							Schwulst points out that social media prioritizes advertising over their users’ needs, and
							the intimidating pressure in creating a website in this newer era of the web. “No one is
							looking out for you… but you.” Individual websites are a place for users to clearly show
							who they are. Beyond that, they have the potential for all kinds of intentions, and don’t
							have to be limited to one website. Schwulst’s favourite aspect of individual websites is
							the duality of them, of being both creator and architect, leading to endless possibilities.
							She advocates for individual websites because they are essential to guiding the future of
							the web. Having the input of individuals gives the web a wider variety of works. It can be
							a mutually beneficial loop of creativity, especially for artists. I agree with Schwulst.
							Social media is a place to show people who you are, share your interests/works, or connect
							with each other, but it’s all within a specific format that is uniform throughout each
							user. Tumblr is a good example of/start to the idea of individual websites. It allows
							people to create blogs of their own and even allows for custom themes, but again it still
							has limitations that connect the blogs as part of Tumblr. Individual websites would be a
							step further from this, and I think it would be more fun and unique, allowing a person to
							fully express themself, and is a good opportunity to learn how to code.
						</p>
						<h3>
							In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites.
							Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website.
						</h3>
						<p>
							Just as a book is a collection of pages about a central theme/plot, websites are the same.
							These pages are all bound up neatly within its titled cover or domain name. Lost your page?
							Check back with the table of contents, with sections labelled and numbered for easy
							navigation. The book could be part of a larger series in the library that is the web,
							specializing in a certain type of information. It could be an educational book, perhaps an
							encyclopedia. Or it could just be a fun book to pass the time. You can bookmark your
							favourite pages and come back to it as often as you’d like to experience over and over.
							Anyone can write a book of their own, creating their world however they imagine it. The
							book might go through tons of revision as it gradually comes together. The process is just
							as important as the end product.
