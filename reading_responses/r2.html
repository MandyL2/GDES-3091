			<h1>
				1. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think
				one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.
			</h1>
			Between flat and skeuo, I don’t think one is better than the other. I agree with Chimero’s rebuttal
			of the two ideologies. Insisting that screens care about how the interfaces being displayed on them
			look doesn’t make sense. The idea of screens being aesthetically neutral is an ideology I can
			believe in. It reminds me of a blank canvas with endless potential. How one chooses to “paint” or
			design it is up to personal preference and their goal. I think both flat and skeuo designs look
			great. Flat designs make me think of minimalism, and give a clean, sharp feeling. Skeuo is
			interesting because of it’s near-tangible visible metaphors. Although screens are flat, the
			contrast of realistic textures can provide emphasis. It also may be more intuitive for some users
			because it has a stronger resemblance to the physical object a design is referring to, like
			buttons. A button that looks more three-dimensional might take less prompting to click, compared to
			a flat one. Therefore it’s up to the designers to decide between flat and skeuo, not the screens.

			<h1>
				2. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another
				example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.
			</h1>

			A zoopraxiscope is a glass disc with photographs radially printed on them. The disc would be lit
			from behind as they spun to produce a moving image, similar to animated GIFs in today’s media. It
			relates to web and interaction design as one of the origins of screens, a component that makes up
			the digital world of web. Working with web and interaction design and zoopraxiscopes both involve
			managing time, movement, and change. Another medium that has inspired digital design is
			cartography. Maps abstract information in a presentable way that everyone can understand, the same
			way interaction design displays information and directs users in a presentable way. Maps can mold
			one’s understanding of the world or distort it. A bad interaction design can distort the users view
			on the web, but like the expression mentioned in the reading, “the map is not the territory.” More
			designs with better interactions or displays of information can be made.

			<h1> 3. Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not. </h1>

			Previously in my first response, I agreed with Chimero that screens shouldn’t dictate designs, as
			they are aesthetically neutral. I don’t think screens want flux, but designers should. Chimero
			defines flux as “the capacity for change” such as responsiveness, customization, and variability.
			It encompasses a variety of possibilities, such as being able to show change in a spreadsheet,
			immersive interactive pieces, interactivity, etc. As the web continues to evolve, having the
			capacity for change would be an advantage. Flux helps designers think about functional design, how
			it would respond to user interaction. Responsive design has become increasingly popular and is a
			part of flux. Chimero concludes that what screens want should be secondary to what we as designers
			want and that we should be able to choose what our technology does. In this way, I think we should
			also want flux beyond just a design standpoint. We should want to have the capacity for change in
			general, creating a new web to fit new visions and goals.
