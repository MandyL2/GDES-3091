			<h3>
				What are some challenges you face when giving a critique? How do you handle a critique that you
				disagree with? Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques?
			</h3>
			I struggle with giving critiques in general and thinking about how a work could be improved. I’m
			also afraid of hurting others’ feelings. I try to ask questions about the work, its inspirations,
			and point out parts that really stand out to me. If I get a critique I disagree with, I thank the
			person anyway because their intention was to provide feedback, but maybe it doesn’t fit the vision
			I had for it. I may think it over again later. I think it’s important to give and receive critiques
			because it can help to greatly improve a piece of work, and also creates a space for artists to
			grow and support each other. Receiving critiques can give a new perspective, because staring at the
			same work for so long can make you grow so accustomed to it that you don’t notice anything off (in
			my experience at least). As the creator, you’re already aware of the intentions behind the artwork,
			and having others critique the work helps to see how that intention is being conveyed/perceived.
			Receiving critiques can also provide a clearer direction for those that are stuck or indecisive
			between multiple ideas. Giving critiques improves communication and observation skills.
