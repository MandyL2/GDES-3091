				<h2> Reading 5: The Poetry of Tools </h2>
			</a>
			<h3>
				1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize
				our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her
				use of the word poetry?
			</h3>
			Seu begins her post with a quote from Dave Jhave Johnston about digital poetry, how it isn’t
			strictly “’poems’ written by ‘poets,’” but can range from ads to interactive displays. To create
			these “poems,” things such as algorithms, social media, and data are used, making them poetic
			tools. Seu thinks of technology as a form of language and a tool with poetic potential. After
			framing poetry and its poetic tools in this way, Seu then asks her readers to “defamiliarize our
			tools.” According to Google, to defamiliarize is to “render unfamiliar or strange.” This is often
			used in the context of art to see things from a new perspective. In her post Seu points out how
			often we use our devices with gestures that are natural to us. It becomes a mindless action and
			feels almost empty. If we defamiliarize our tools, it would mean stepping back from these automatic
			gestures and thinking of how to create interactions that are meaningful through a new perspective.
			It would enhance the poetic potential of a piece to further convey its meaning/story.
			<h3>
				2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early
				Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration).
				Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or
				online interface*not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition.
				Explain why.
			</h3>
			The Production of Errors taxonomy purposely takes the mistakes we make, such as those in the
			digital correspondence of our daily lives and transforms them into a piece of commentary, art, or
			humor. It embraces errors, even creating opportunities for more errors.
			<a href="https://lingojam.com/BadTranslator"> Bad Translator</a> is a website that fits within this
			definition. It plays upon bad English translations jokingly referred to as “Engrish” that are often
			found in East Asian countries. This is due to the difference in the language structures being
			translated to English through apps such as Google Translate. Sometimes it is purposely put on
			clothing just for aesthetic purposes, similar to how clothing in the West will have random Chinese
			or Japanese characters. Bad Translator takes sentences from the user to create an “Engrish” version
			of it, embracing the errors to create something humorous. The creator behind Bad Translator was
			actually worried about translation apps becoming so good that the funny translations would cease to
			exist, prompting them to create the site to preserve them while also providing the history and
			context behind it.
