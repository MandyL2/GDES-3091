					<h2> Brainstorming </h2>
					<p>
						I originally had 3 ideas for the theme of my INDEX. The first was a kind of retro, early
						2000s computer aesthetic. The second went in the opposite direction with an analogue feel of
						a newspaper/scrapbook. The third theme was inspired by 80s Hong Kong cinema with bright and
						bold neon signs.

						I tried to make the home page look like a desktop, with little folders instead of a
						navigation bar. I'm happy I was able to replicate the original sketch so closely, although I
						wasn't able to add the glitchy bars overlapping the windows.

						Here I was just figuring out the layout of this page. Sticking with the computer theme, I
						used iframes to my advantage to create windows of each reading. The window would pop up once
						the user clicked on the reading in the navigation list. Originally I was going to have them
						pop up below each other and have the user scroll down to see them all.

					<p>
						I decided to keep everything within view and set the overflow to hidden. Following the
						references I had, I made them overlap once shown, similar to all those error window pop-ups.
						I was able to implement jQuery to allow the user to rearrange the windows as well. The
						X-button in the corner of the windows are functional as well, hiding the window from view
						when clicked. The user can reopen the window by selecting it in the navigation list on the
						side.

						Final styling. I added a window for any references I used when creating this page and had
						that theme throughout the rest of the website. I also edited the readings themselves to fit
						more with the website's aesthetic and added a link to each reading to give context to my
						answers. I made the text hierarchy clear in the readings: the reading title/link is h2, the
						questions are h3, and the answers are body copy text. I kept the little navigation folders in
						the bottom left like a computer taskbar.

						Here I also had a window to the side for all the references I used to create the 3 projects.
						This layout was meant to look more like a file explorer, and clicking on each folder linked
						to the working html page of each project.

						At first I was stumped on how to incorporate my exercises in a way that looked consistent
						with the website's theme, but realized I could use the layout of my Reading Responses page.
						The first thing the user sees is the navigation list and references, and Exercise 1 because
						it didn't need the full width of the page. Since the other exercises were designed to be a
						whole webpage, I didn't hide the overflow and made the windows show up below. These can also
						be rearranged and closed. Here you can see the UI Style Guide I made for my website. I ended
						up not using some of the colours, which I think is fine because it makes the palette more
						concise. I liked the purple theme with yellow accents. I didn't need any buttons either so
						they were left out.

					<h2> Conclusion </h2>
					<p>
						Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the final look. It fits the aesthetic I was going for and
						looks pretty consistent. I learned a lot while making this, such as using grids to create
						nicer layouts. It made things a lot easier for me to position. I tried to make sure my code
						was clean, consistent, and efficient as well. This project also allowed me to brush up on my
						version control skills using the terminal.
